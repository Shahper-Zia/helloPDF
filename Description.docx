____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Develop a RAG Based Chatbot Application using the provided dataset:
    1.	Use Langchain/ Llamaindex or any method of your choice.
    2.	Use Chroma DB or similar develop locally.
    3.	Generate synthetic Q&A pairs on given pdf using any of below libraries: Langchain/ llama index/ RAGAS  or any method of your choice and evaluate accuracy of your bot on that dataset.
    4.	Develop UI of Bot in Streamlit/chainlit.
    5.	Application should have below features:
        a.	Frontend of application to be developed using Chainlit/Streamlit.
        b.	For a given user question, output from should contain:
            i.	Answer in text
            ii.	Citations for the answer clickable link, which provides page number from which answer has been generated.
            iii. Application should have conversational memory. (If you ask follow up question it should take previous conversation history under scope)
            iv.	Conversational memory should be stored via mapping with a session id which can be generated in ChainLit. (goal here is if multiple users are using chatbot at same time, their conversation history would be different)
    6.	Deploy application locally first with UI seen on localhost.
    7.	Once deployed locally deploy app on azure web app.
        a.	(get a azure account on your personal email Id and get 200 dollar as free credit and use that to create a service of azure web app and then deploy)
        b.	Use / create another personal id incase azure free credit exhausted.
